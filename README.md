- This is a good learning experiance and working with team on own project
- Using gitHub we have learned new IDE that is `Jetbrains Intellij IDE` and how to use inbuilt gitHub Plug-in to perform daily activities 
- IDE has a lot of features to integrate with gitHub and git client.
- We can fetch, pull, add, commit, push, shelve changes, adding remote repository.
- Comparing local history and gitHub history is possible using IDE.
- I enjoyed working using terminal/commnd prompt/ gitBash. The more we use commands more our concepts gets clear.
- To solve merge conflits is easy using IDE plug-in instead of using command prompt diff or raw file.
