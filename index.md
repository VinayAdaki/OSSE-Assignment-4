## Welcome to OSSE-Assignment-4 for Group 3

GitHub pages are basically to show that gitHub pages are useful when we work on any open source project.
This is a good platform to showcase what our product does and even we do not need to host any websiite for this.
Using gitHub pages and free templets we can build our static web page and share with others.

### About project
